Reboot Now!

Based on the overwhelming poularity of our ShutdownNow! program, 
Lightning in a Cone is proud to bring you our newest utility: RebootNow!

RebootNow! is a simple bash script that resides on your desktop for quick reboots.

To use: 
1. Put the RebootNow script on your desktop in a convenient location
2. To activate, right click and select "Run as a Program"

RebootNow will immediately reboot your system.

Why:
Because normal rebooting with a GUI takes 4 mouse clicks 
and rebooting with Terminal/CLI, while faster than the regular GUI, is still 
more than two mouse clicks.

Upcoming changes:
Todo: App icon to look like a button.
Todo: Change functionality to activate script on left click or left double-click
Todo: Put app into launcher bar for convenient storage (clear the desktop)
